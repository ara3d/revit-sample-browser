# Ara 3D Revit Sample Browser

This project is a single Revit plug-in project that provides a Windows Forms UI to browse and activate most of the Revit SDK C# samples for Revit 2024. 
The code for the samples were taken from [Jeremy Tammik's Revit SDK Samples](https://github.com/jeremytammik/RevitSdkSamples), were merged together in a single project
with some code style changes applied via ReSharper, and some regular expression magic.
