# Ara 3D Revit Sample Browser

The project was inspired by [Jeremy Tammik's Revit SDK Samples](https://github.com/jeremytammik/RevitSdkSamples). 

It includes most of the Revit SDK C# samples for Revit 2024, in a single compilable project with a Windows Forms UI for reading the documentation and activating the appropriate plug-in.
