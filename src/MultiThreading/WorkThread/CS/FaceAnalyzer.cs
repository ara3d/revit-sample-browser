    ///   The calculation is delegated to a work-thread. The analyzer kicks
    ///   off the calculation and then returns to Revit. Periodically Revit
    ///   checks (during an Idling event) if there is more results available.
    ///   If there is, the analyzer grabs them from the work-thread and takes
    ///   care of the visualization. The thread lets the analyzer to know when 
    ///   the calculation is finally over. When that happens, the application
    ///   can unregister from Idling since it does not need it anymore.

    ///   Optionally, Revit can interrupt the analysis, which it typically does
    ///   when the element being analyzed changes (or gets deleted). Depending
